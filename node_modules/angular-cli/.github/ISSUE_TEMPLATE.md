1. OS. Windows 7, 8 or 10. Linux (which distribution). Mac OSX (Yosemite? El Capitan?)
2. Versions. Please run `ng --version`. If there's nothing outputted, please
   run in a Terminal: 

        node --version
        npm --version
        npm info angular-cli
   And paste the result here.
3. Repro steps. Tell us exactly what you did and how you came to the failure. 
   If you can give us steps from the moment you created an empty application,
   even better! Please try to be as descriptive as you can; this will avoid
   unnecessary back and forth. Was this an app that wasn't created using the
   CLI? What change did you do on your code? etc.
4. The log given by the failure. Normally this include a stack trace and some
   more information.
5. Mention any other details that might be useful.
